        I am an Android Developer at Pursuit with a passion for building mobile applications.
        I have experience with applications that deal with managing accounts and customer information within limousine services,
        building mobile games, and creating videos within technologies such as Adobe Premiere.
        I\'m currently looking for opportunities that will allow me to continue building my skill set
        in either mobile applications or the gaming sector.</string>
